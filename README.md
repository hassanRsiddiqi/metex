**METEX**
is my first concurrent Application in elixir, which uses Actor, Worker & Coordinator.

### How to use

Clone the Project `git clone "https://github.com/hassanRsiddiqi/metex"`

goto project directory & run `iex -S mix`

```
cities = ["Multan","Singapore", "Monaco", "Vatican City", "Hong Kong", "Macau"]
Metex.temp cities
```
